There is now some small attempt at prioritisation in this file, 
higher priority stuff should be at the top of the file, 
lower priority at the bottom. It is currently only vaguely correct.

	Bugs:
	- Player options can become scrambled
          if accessed too often.
	- Wrap around ceiling should not destroy projectile.
	- Make sure network client doesn't get
          unlimited shots.
	- Atanks crashes when Windows players click the Network option
          in the main Options menu.
	- When cycling through tanks on Players screen,
	  the old tank does not get erased.
	- AI controlled tanks buy a limited number of defensive
          upgrades during very long games. Plating, for example.


	Features:
	- Add scroll bar to buying screen.
	- Add randomize button to buying screen to have
	  items automatically purchased.

   	- Field repair kit: Spend a turn to repair your tank 
          rather than fire.           
          Limited uses, heals more than Auto Repair Kit 
	- Radar resistant missile: A missile designed to 
          avoid the missile defence system by masking 
          its heat signature 
          Yield: Large missile
	- Better AI against tanks with SDI.
	- Update client ground surface more often.
	- When switching languages, player menu should display correct text.
	- Client needs a buying screen.
	- Make tank size variable.
	- Add rocks as semi-destructable items.
        - First aid kit that you can shoot to a friendly tank.



===============================================

	   Items from here to the bottom of the file
	   are under consideration by the development
	   team and may (or may not) be implemented.

	-- Harder ground

	-- High voltage missiles (discharge on impact or when within range)
		(Bharat Dhareshwar)

	-- Tornadoes (pick up tanks and objects) (Bharat Dhareshwar)
