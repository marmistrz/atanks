There is now some small attempt at prioritisation in this file, 
higher priority stuff should be at the top of the file, 
lower priority at the bottom. It is currently only vaguely correct.

	Bugs:
	- Player options can become scrambled
          if accessed too often.
	- Wrap around ceiling should not destroy projectile.
	- Make sure network client doesn't get
          unlimited shots.
	- Atanks crashes when Windows players click the Network option
          in the main Options menu.
	- When cycling through tanks on Players screen,
	  the old tank does not get erased.
	- AI controlled tanks buy a limited number of defensive
          upgrades during very long games. Plating, for example.

In player.cpp the PLAYER::computerSelectItem selects a weapon or item for the bot to use.
Values less than WEAPONS are weapons and values from WEAPONS to THINGS are items.
After lots of black magic to select a weapon or item, finally in line 3567 the current_weapon containing a value from 0 to THINGS is passed to PLAYER::computerSelectTarget, which in line 3189 uses it as index into the array weapon which only has size WEAPONS, resulting in a segfault.
Line 3561 also calls PLAYER::computerSelectTarget with a value from 0 to THINGS, so probably the same can happen there.
I don't know how to fix this, since I don't know how PLAYER::computerSelectTarget should behave when an item is passed instead of a weapon, but probaly some of you know this and can fix.

	   team and may (or may not) be implemented.
