There is now some small attempt at prioritisation in this file, 
higher priority stuff should be at the top of the file, 
lower priority at the bottom. It is currently only vaguely correct.

	Bugs:
	- Player options can become scrambled
          if accessed too often.
          -> Should be fixed with atanks-5.9_aiu1
	- Wrap around ceiling should not destroy projectile.
          -> Of course it should. Wrapping is only horizontal, not vertical.
          -> Added a new option to enable that in atanks-6.0_aiu8
	- Make sure network client doesn't get
          unlimited shots.
	- Atanks crashes when Windows players click the Network option
          in the main Options menu.
          -> Should be fixed with atanks-5.9_aiu1
	- When cycling through tanks on Players screen,
	  the old tank does not get erased.
          -> Should be fixed with atanks-5.9_aiu1
	- AI controlled tanks buy a limited number of defensive
          upgrades during very long games. Plating, for example.

In player.cpp the PLAYER::computerSelectItem selects a weapon or item for the bot to use.
Values less than WEAPONS are weapons and values from WEAPONS to THINGS are items.
After lots of black magic to select a weapon or item, finally in line 3567 the current_weapon containing a value from 0 to THINGS is passed to PLAYER::computerSelectTarget, which in line 3189 uses it as index into the array weapon which only has size WEAPONS, resulting in a segfault.
Line 3561 also calls PLAYER::computerSelectTarget with a value from 0 to THINGS, so probably the same can happen there.
I don't know how to fix this, since I don't know how PLAYER::computerSelectTarget should behave when an item is passed instead of a weapon, but probaly some of you know this and can fix.
          -> This is fixed in atanks-6.1_aiu2

	Features:
	- Add scroll bar to buying screen.
	- Add randomize button to buying screen to have
	  items automatically purchased.
   	- Field repair kit: Spend a turn to repair your tank 
          rather than fire.           
          Limited uses, heals more than Auto Repair Kit 
	- Radar resistant missile: A missile designed to 
          avoid the missile defence system by masking 
          its heat signature 
          Yield: Large missile
	- Better AI against tanks with SDI.
          -> Added in atanks-6.1_aiu3
	- Update client ground surface more often.
	- When switching languages, player menu should display correct text.
          -> Should be fixed with atanks-5.9_aiu1
	- Client needs a buying screen.
	- Make tank size variable.
          -> It is in atanks-6.0_aiu? Don't remember which...
	- Add rocks as semi-destructable items.


===============================================

	   Items from here to the bottom of the file
	   are under consideration by the development
	   team and may (or may not) be implemented.   

===============================================


        -- under ground mines

	-- rocket like fireworks

	-- Make it possible to shoot down the UFO

	-- Make main window scalable
           (Needs to wait until Allegro 5.x)
           -> Allegro 5 is a no-opt. I gave up on it but will try SFML-2 soon.

	-- Harder ground
           -> What is that supposed to mean?

	-- High voltage missiles (discharge on impact or when within range)
		(Bharat Dhareshwar)

	-- Tornadoes (pick up tanks and objects) (Bharat Dhareshwar)

	-- Another level of armour improvement
