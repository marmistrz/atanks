Grr!
I worship the ground that awaits your corpse
You are not even beneath my contempt
Your father was a hamster!
Your mother smells of elderberries!
Curse you!
I'll get you next time!
I'll get you!
YOU RAT!
Hey, mush-brain!
It's only a flesh-wound!
Je ne suis pas un poisson
I hate you!
I'll be back!
You'll suffer for this!
You'll regret that!
I'm not dead... yet
why me?
That was low
I'm... speechless
Oh, I'm so scared!
I can see a light
Oh pooh
You'll only get me over my dead tank
